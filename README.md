Key Features:
RSA Key Pair Generation: Securely generate private and public keys.
Certificate Signing Request (CSR): Create a CSR for further use.
Self-Signed Certificate: Generate a self-signed certificate for testing and secure communications.
Why This Project?
Openssl helps in securing the communications and achieving authentications with its encryption and decryption 
methods through the use of keys. Understanding encryption and secure communications is crucial in today's digital age.
This library is good in implementing cryptographic techniques to enhance web security using different algorithms like sha256.
